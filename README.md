# Nand2Tetris
Code for The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles, aka Nand2Tetris

Nand2Tetris is an ambitious course that builds a complete computer virtually starting with only nand gates creates gates such as and, or, not, mux; uses those gates to create adders, an ALU, program counter, RAM, register, CPU; creates an assembler to convert assembly language to binary; creates a virtual machine to convert stack based virtual machine commands to assembly; creates a compiler for a Java-esque high-level language into stack-based virtual machine code.

The course content can be downloaded from https://www.nand2tetris.org on the "software" page.
